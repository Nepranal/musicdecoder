2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mcdecoder_inst/temp_dout_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mcdecoder_inst/temp_dout_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell mcdecoder_inst/temp_dout_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mcdecoder_inst/temp_dvalid__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mcdecoder_inst/temp_dvalid_reg_i_1/O, cell mcdecoder_inst/temp_dvalid_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net myuart_inst/sout_temp_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin myuart_inst/sout_temp_reg/L3_2/O, cell myuart_inst/sout_temp_reg/L3_2 (in myuart_inst/sout_temp_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net symb_det_inst/symb_out_temp__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin symb_det_inst/symb_out_temp_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell symb_det_inst/symb_out_temp_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	clr_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to U18
	clr_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y1
